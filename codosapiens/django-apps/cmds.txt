settings.py is like the configration file for your website
urls.py says go to the mentioned url and do the function

python3 manage.py runserver #Starts the server on localhost at port 8000

python3 manage.py startapp <app name> # Creates an app

in the <app name> dir we have .py called apps.py which is the config file

models.py is like the blueprint
views.py is like request and response to a user

in the main urls.py include what should be done when a specific url is requested in the list urlpatterns

To pass parameters put <int:album_id>

Always you should or import the corresponding modules

./manage.py migrate sinks all the apps with the database
(and also after every makemigrations)

in the music/ create a class models.py and the variable in the class will become the columns of a table.

and every class in the models.py will inherit the base class models.Model

giving foreign keys is column name = models.ForeignKey(Album, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
After creating the models to apply them run the command
./manage.py makemigrations <appname>
./manage.py sqlmigrate <appname> <idname>
<idname> is obtained by running the makemigrations command

After creating the app give the app config name in the main settings.py file (<appname>/apps.py)

./manage.py shell -> opens the database shell
This shell can be used to add database entries in the tables
select in this is similar to declaring class and can be saved by
a.save()
a.id ~ a.pk
Album.objects.filter(id=1) # Searching for id one
Album.objects.filter(artist__startswith="Tay")

To create an admin
./manage.py createsuperuser

To delete a user
./manage.py shell
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
User.objects.get(username=<uname>, is_superuser=True).delete()

in an app goto admin and then register the class to see them in page
from .models import <class name>
admin.site.register(<class name>)
