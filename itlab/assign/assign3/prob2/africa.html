        Africa is the world's second largest and second most-populous continent, 
        being behind Asia in both categories. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million 
        square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total 
        surface area and 20% of its land area. With 1.2 billion people as of 2016, it 
        accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded 
        by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the 
        northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. 
        The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully 
        recognised sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent 
        states with limited or no recognition.[4] The majority of the continent and 
        its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and 
        number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere.
