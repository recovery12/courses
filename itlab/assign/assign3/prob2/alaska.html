        Alaska (/əˈlæskə/ (About this soundlisten); Aleut: Alax̂sxax̂; Inupiaq: 
        Alaasikaq; Alutiiq: Alas'kaaq; Tlingit: Anáaski; Russian: Аляска, 
        romanized: Alyaska) is a U.S. state in the northwest extremity of the 
        United States West Coast, just across the Bering Strait from Asia. The 
        Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon border the 
        state to the east and southeast. Its most extreme western part is Attu 
        Island, and it has a maritime border with Russia (Chukotka Autonomous Okrug)
        to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and 
        Beaufort seas—southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies 
        to the south and southwest. It is the largest U.S. state by area and the
        seventh largest subnational division in the world. In addition, it is the
        3rd least populous and the most sparsely populated of the 50 United 
        States; nevertheless, it is by far the most populous territory located 
        mostly north of the 60th parallel in North America: its population—estimated
        at 738,432 by the United States Census Bureau in 2015[4]— is more than 
        quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland. 
        Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan
        area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil 
        industries, resources which it has in abundance. United States armed forces bases 
        and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.
