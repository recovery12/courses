        State"), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a country in 
        East Asia and the world's most populous country, with a population of around
        1.404 billion.[10] Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers 
        (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the third or fourth largest country by total area. 
        Governed by the Communist Party of China, the state exercises jurisdiction

        (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative 
        regions of Hong Kong and Macau.
