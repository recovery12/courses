            Greenland (Greenlandic: Kalaallit Nunaat, pronounced [kalaːɬit nunaːt]; 
            Danish: Grønland, pronounced [ˈkʁɶnˌlænˀ]) is an autonomous country of 
            the Kingdom of Denmark, located between the Arctic and Atlantic 
            oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically 
            art of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and 
            culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the 
            colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than 
            a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors 
            migrated from Alaska through Northern Canada, gradually settling across the 
            island by the 13th century. Nowadays the population is largely 
            concentrated on the southwest coast of the island while the rest of the 
            island is underpopulated. Greenland is divided into five municipalities - 
            Sermersooq, Kujalleq, Qeqertalik, Qeqqata, and Avannaata - and has two 
            unincorporated area - the Northeast Greenland National Park and the Thule 
            Air Base, administered by the United States Air Force. Greenland does 
            not have an independent seat at the United Nations.
