        Russia (Russian: Росси́я, tr. Rossiya, IPA: [rɐˈsʲijə]), or the Russian 
        Federation[12] (Russian: Росси́йская Федера́ция, tr. Rossiyskaya Federatsiya, 
        IPA: [rɐˈsʲijskəjə fʲɪdʲɪˈratsɨjə]), is a transcontinental country in Eastern 
        Europe and North Asia. At 17,125,200 square kilometres (6,612,100 sq mi),
        Russia is by a considerable margin the largest country in the world by area,
        covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area,
        and the ninth most populous, with about 146.79 million people as of 2019, 
        including Crimea. About 77% of the population live in the western, 
        European part of the country. Russia's capital, Moscow, is one of the largest 
        cities in the world and the second largest city in Europe; other major cities 
        include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and Nizhny Novgorod. Extending 
        across the entirety of Northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans 
        eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait. However, Russia recognises two more countries that border it, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which are internationally recognized as parts of Georgia.
