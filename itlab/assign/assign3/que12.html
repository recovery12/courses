            CSS: <br>
            CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, 
            including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the 
            presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens,
            small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be 
            used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML 
            from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets 
            across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is 
            referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from 
            presentation.

            ImageMap: <br>
            In Web page development, an image map is a graphic image defined 
            so that a user can click on different areas of the image and be 
            linked to different destinations. You make an image map by defining
            each of the sensitive areas in terms of their x and y coordinates 
            (that is, a certain horizontal distance and a certain vertical 
            distance from the left-hand corner of the image). With each set of 
            coordinates, you specify a Uniform Resource Locator or Web address
            that will be linked to when the user clicks on that area.
