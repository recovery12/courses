        In the first quadrant (0° to 90°), all trigonometric ratios are positive.
        In the second quadrant (90° to 180°), sin and csc are positive and other trigonometric ratios are negative.    
        In the third quadrant (180° to 270°), tan and cot are positive and other trigonometric ratios are negative.    
        In the fourth quadrant (270° to 360°), cos and sec are positive and other trigonometric ratios are negative.

        Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with 
        encryption, the conversion of information from a readable state to 
        apparent nonsense. The originator of an encrypted message shares the 
        decoding technique only with intended recipients to preclude access 
        from adversaries. The cryptography literature often uses the names Alice
        ("A") for the sender, Bob ("B") for the intended recipient, and Eve 
        ("eavesdropper") for the adversary.[5] Since the development of rotor 
        cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II, 
        the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex 
        and its application more widespread.
