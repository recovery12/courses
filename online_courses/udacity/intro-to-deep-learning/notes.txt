boundary line:
w1x1 + w2x2 + b(bias) = 0 (2d)
Wx + b = 0

prediction is 1 if Wx+b >= 0
		if Wx+b < 0

perception is the logic which is present in the nodes.

perception algorithms

for gradient descent the error function needs to be continuous and differntiable.

softmax function.

negative of the logirithm of the probablities is called as cross entropies.
Cross entropy should be as low as possible.

it is a sum of the -log(factors)
factors may be happening/not happending a event

check cross entropy once again.
