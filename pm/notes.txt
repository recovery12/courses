objdump is used to display the assembly language and machine language from the executeable file.
The command used is objdump -D ./<filename> | grep -A20 main.:

The grep part displays only the first 20 lies of the code.
There are 2 syntax's AT&T and intel, if u find % and $ that is AT&T ones otherwise it is intel syntax intel syntax is more readable

For intel syntax command  is objdump -M intel -D ./<filename> | grep -A20 main.:
