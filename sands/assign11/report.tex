    \large{Q1) Write a report on the curves obtained by plotting the graph of 
    $w^{-nk}$ for different values of n and k?$ (n, k\in [0,N))$}\\
  \end{flushleft}
  \begin{center}
    $w = e^{\imath\frac{2\pi}{N}}$, where N = 16\\

  \large{A) }
  a) For n = 1 and 15 the graphs are almost similar to the sinusoidal wave.\\
  b) As, n increases from 1 the distance between the y-coordinate 
     is also increasing.\\
  c) The distance becomes constant for values of 8, 9.\\
  d) Then onwards it starts decresing and becomes almost zero.\\
  e) The ratio of y/x in $x\pm\imath y$ is always positive for all values of n\\
  f) Except for n = 8, it is negative.\\
  g) The magnitude of the ratio is in the order of $10^{14}$(roughly).\\
  h) The plot of $\theta$(phase) and k is also giving a periodic curve.\\
  i) Most of the graph`s have sharp edges, only a few have a smooth curve.\\
  j) The frequency of the curves monotonically increases and then it decreses.\\
