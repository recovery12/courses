    $w^{-nk}$ for different values of n and k?$ (n, k\in [0,16))$}\\

  \large{A) }
  a) For n = 1 and 15 the garphs are almost similar to the sin wave.\\
  b) As, n increses from 1 the distance between the y-coordinate 
     is also incresing.\\
  c) The distance becomes constant for values of 8, 9.\\
  d) Then onwards it starts decresing and becomes almost zero.\\
  e) The ratio of y/x in $x\pm\imath y$ is always positive for all values of n\\
  f) Except for n = 8, it is negative.\\
  g) The magnitude of the ratio is in the order of $10^{14}$(roughly).\\
